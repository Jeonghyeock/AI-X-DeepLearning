        "review = \"A simple farm guy named Copper (Matthew McConaughey) and a few other experts go into outer space to explore other worlds that might sustain human life. It seems that that life on Earth might not survive due to to some unexplained environmental disaster. Naturally nothing goes right. WAY overpraised and terrible sci-fi movie. When I heard the plot from this I expected the worst. Writer/director Christopher Nolan has never been a favorite for me--I HATE what he did to Batman in his movie trilogy. I thought that he as trying to imitate Stanley Kubrick ('2001') here but it's far worse--he's doing Steven Spielberg! The movie runs WAY too long (165 minutes) and they're constantly pushing family friendly values in your face. Cooper's non-stop yammering about his daughter got on my nerves instantly. Also that stupid fake southern accent he adopts is immediately annoying. The story is very slow and all the characters are cardboard cutouts you've seen in other movies. The special effects are flawless and there's some beautiful cinematography here but the extreme length and boring story really weigh it down. Any sort of statement they're trying to make on time and life is completely deadened by the script. Also this movie is very manipulative and way too sentimental. They go out of their way to make the audience cry--like at a Spielberg movie. Well I did cry--tears of joy at the end that this was over! Also the gaps in logic and plot holes here are very annoying. I lost track of how many times I rolled my eyes at the dubious 'logic' served up here. The acting was as good as it could be (I guess) but, at the end, they throw in a surprise guest star (who I won't name). It didn't help because I think he's a terrible actor and this didn't change my mind. I was bored and looked at my watch MANY times while this played. It's boring, obvious and manipulative. Why is this getting so much praise? Skip it.\"\n",

I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time. Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet\"\n",

        "review = \"Another outer space film from Hollywood, this time directed by INCEPTION's Christopher Nolan. Thankfully it's better than the overrated GRAVITY, but INTERSTELLAR soon turns out to be overrated in turn. It seems that as soon as a film comes out these days with a half intelligent premise, critics and audiences lap it up and rate it as one of the best ever. INTERSTELLAR is far from that. It has plenty of interesting moments, but the overlong running time is padded and bloated with endless sentimentalism and extraneous characters. It also takes a heck of a lot of time for anything to actually happen. Matthew McConaughey is all earnestness as the protagonist and comes across as a dullard; Anne Hathaway's character is completely extraneous and lacking in charisma. Only old timers like John Lithgow and Michael Caine shine, although Wes Bentley is underutilised in his role. An unexpected appearance from Matt Damon is undoubtedly the story's highlight. For much of the running time this follows the template of a typical space adventure, but around the middle part of the film it starts to get weighed down with endless CGI effects and the whole end part of the production gets muddled and predictable in equal measure, coming across like a rip off of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY but not nearly as good.\"\n",

        "review = \"OK, time for me to turn in my Christopher Nolan card. Ever since 'Memento,' I've been waiting for Christopher Nolan to make another film that isn't a big hot mess, and it seems I will be waiting forever. He comes up with terrific conceits that clearly make sense to him, but he simply cannot translate them to the screen and make them intelligible to anyone else. 'Interstellar' is his latest load of hooey, nearly three hours of sci-fi mumbo jumbo queasily married to a sentimental father/daughter drama. It goes on forever and includes all manner of tangents that a more concise writer or editor (anybody, please!) would have excised. Indeed, Nolan's biggest failing as a writer/director is that he can't seem to get his thoughts organized, and every movie he makes feels like a rough draft that no one ever got around to assembling into a coherent narrative. To give him credit, 'Interstellar' isn't anywhere nearly as incoherent as 'The Prestige' or 'Inception,' and it's not as leadenly humorless and self-important as 'The Dark Knight,' but it's just as exasperating as all of those other movies in its tendency to start with a good concept that it then buries under a heap of directorial self indulgence. I learned a long time ago to simply stop going to see Oliver Stone or Spike Lee movies when I realized that neither was ever going to make a good movie, and I guess I now have to add Nolan to that dubious list.\"\n",

The former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) lives in a farm in the countryside with his teenage son Tom, his daughter Murph and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). Murph is convinced that there is a ghost in her room trying to communicate with her and Cooper decodes a message with a coordinate. He heads to the location and finds a hidden NASA facility. Cooper meets Professor Brand (Michael Caine) that explains that they have found a wormhole and sent several spacecraft to seek a planet to send mankind. Only three of them are returning signals and now they want to launch the spacecraft Endurance to recover the collected data. He invites Cooper to be the pilot of Endurance and travel with his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway); the scientists Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi); and the robots TARS and CASE. Cooper accepts and Murph is overwhelmed with his decision. Copper crosses the wormhole to a distant galaxy in the beginning of a dangerous trip to save mankind. 'Interstellar' is a sci-fi with a pretentious and overrated trip by the Hollywood darling Christopher Nolan. The story has a promising beginning, but becomes totally nonsense in the moment that Cooper leaves Brand. The plot is pretentious and uses Einstein relativity theory and other scientific concepts that are impossible to know whether they have scientific accuracy or not. My vote is six.\"\n",

        "review = \"This film is not recommended. Interstellar must be renamed to 2015: A Space Oddity. Once there is lift-off, there is much gravitas and solemn beauty in its weightless universe, even if the film bogs down whenever it tethers itself to Earth, its inhabitants, and their on-going battle with global change. (Yes, you naysayers, it was real!) ￼ The film owes its whole existence to the granddaddy of all space exploration films, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Interstellar is similar in its alignment to scientific probabilities, quantum physics, and algorithms with much talk about wormholes, black holes, time travel, and anomalies. The further connection to Kubrick's masterpiece is even more evident with the episodic nature in Interstellar's plot structure, its minimal in character development (except for its lead character), and its overtly pretentious and sanctimonious tone. More odd in its dramatic flourishes than needed, Nolan's film reaches for the heavens but never soars to any level of greatness. The film is earnest, well-crafted, and stylishly directed, but hardly emotionally involving. Blame the overstuffed script (by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan) for the lack of any real tension or satisfaction. Sections of the film just never gel, leading to an ending that is visually stunning and total nonsense. ￼ The film also owes some of its technical prowess to last year's Gravity in its overall visual look. (That film did it all so much better.) Still the visuals are Interstellar's chief asset (with a dazzling set piece set in the fourth dimension that is especially dazzling in the IMAX format). This film is a long-drawn-out sci-fi fantasy, a seriously-minded adventure film that is takes itself too seriously with scientific exposition and high-brow poetic pause that make the film too solemn and corny to truly enjoy. ￼ Now, let's discuss the story and characters a bit. It is the future and Earth is a dustbin with its population dwindling. Our only hope is what lies above. A team of astronauts is assembled to find another world from three other planets in another galaxy on which we can co-habitat. Leading this crew is a man who must have the right stuff, aptly named Cooper played by Matthew McConaughey. Coop is a widow raising two small children and obsessing with enough pangs of patriarchal guilt and crying jags to possibly earn another Oscar. Sent by old school scientist Dr. Brand (Michael Caine), who is receiving a weak signal from outer space, he bids adieu to his young wards to go space-ward, leaving the coop and his smart daughter Murph (MacKenzie Foy) and older son Tom (Timothée Chalamet) behind in order to help mankind and save his family from an ultimate death. Time passes quickly for these earthlings (and all too slowly for the audience) as 23 years pass and Murph and Tom have grown up, becoming Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck while Coop stays forever young. Of course, there will be snags in this mission. Pardon the pun: it's Murphy's Law. Also on board are other space travelers: Dr. Brand's daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway) who acts more Bedelia than Earhart, a nondescript Doyle (Wes Bentley), and Romilly (David Gyasi) as the token African-American astronaut and one of the few minorities on screen. Off they go on their spacecraft named Endurance, an apt title indeed! ￼ The acting is barely adequate and well, under stellar. The characters barely register as real people as they continually wax philosophically about life, physics, love, mathematics, and the pursuit of happiness. Their dialogues never resemble anything remotely convincing. Again, the screenplay's poor plotting and weak characterizations aborts their mission. With Interstellar, the sum of its parts are greater than the whole (or hole). In fact, there seem to be an overabundance of holes in Interstellar: black holes, wormholes, and plot holes, the latter being the most dangerous and unavoidable one due to the Brothers Nolans' sappy screenplay. The episodic structure of the film is unable to connect its story lines to make any logical sense. Nolan's film is a major disappointment. In retrospect, perhaps an even better name for Interstellar might be Close Encounters of the Third Rate Kind. At times, the film is a visual pleasure, fitfully entertaining and thought-provoking in its overall production design. But more often, Interstellar is just dull, uninspiring, and a long, long journey into that good night.\"\n",

Cristopher Nolan is my favorite director and I know that he could make amazing things, but Interstaller wasn't good enough. It reminded me a little of Gravity and it was too science fiction, with many humanity dilemmas that weren't philosophized enough, with the subject of time being all too confusing and with the main idea being the bond between father and daughter rather than the future of the humanity. However that last one was a refreshing new one, as the movie didn't focus on saving the earth as many other before it have. Though, from some point, you do want it to be more than that, as it seems to have stuck on the family matter. The whole idea of the They is confusing, not to mention the ending, but this is Nolan, the guy who made Insception, so you can't expect to understand it from the first time.

Unlike, say, Gravity, which was virtually one hundred per cent in space, Intersteller does introduce a human element and is all the better for it.

This movie is relentlessly and thoroughly implausible from its opening scene to the improbable closing where the sole remaining possession of Leon, a potted plant which has miraculously survived, amongst other things, walls of fire, smoke bombs and bazooka attacks, is planted in what appears to be an open lawn! Unbelievable that seemingly 80% or more of near 900 reviewers here have very strangely anointed this movie a near masterpiece. My score of 5 is over-generous considering the litany of implausible character and plot situations. The most incredulous situation is the fact that Mathilda is a 12 year old, sometimes acting her age but more often than not engaging in conversation which is not only that of a mature woman but also appears quite disturbing in light of the sexual tension depicted. And for goodness sake, what 12 year old blithely refers to long dead couples such as Bonnie and Clyde?! The age factor of Mathilda and the implausibility of her words and actions in every scene remain front and center at the startlingly obvious weakness of this movie, regardless of how brilliant Natalie Portman's performance may appear.How incredible that she seems to have taught the near illiterate Leon to read in what seems just over a week. Considering that Leon has been in the US since age 19 and has developed skills as an ace hit-man and YET still can't read English defies credibility. As for Gary Oldman's portrayal of Stansfield, how could the actions of a vicious, destructive pill-popping police officer of seniority go unnoticed? How did he reach such a position in the first place? Totally unbelievable. And how can the near destruction of a hotel in Leon's pursuit of the gangster in the opening scenes, with innumerable rounds of machine gun fire, go unnoticed by anybody else in the building. Unbelievable. No police response until the climax where seemingly hundreds of highly-armed police and commandos with flame throwers and bazookas and smoke bombs and.......absolutely UNBELIEVABLE! So over-rated, so implausible. This bilge borders on parody. Ridiculous movie-making.\"\n",

        "review = \"Luc Besson's film Leon:The Professional is a superb one. Visually, it is very stylish, with striking location work, atmospheric lighting and really authentic and bold cinematography. The soundtrack also does very well in enhancing the mood of each scene, and Besson's direction is faultless. There is also a gripping story with well crafted characters particularly Mathilda and Jean Reno's character Leon, a cracking script and crisp pacing and while there are some over-the-top and intense moments particularly with Stansfield and the beginning, particularly as the chemistry between Mathilda and Leon expands there are some poignant ones too. The acting is excellent. Jean Reno is charismatic and commanding in the title role while Gary Oldman is wildly bombastic as Stansfield. But I was especially impressed by Natalie Portman, who delivers one of the best and most captivating feature debuts ever. In conclusion, a fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox\"\n",

        "review = \"Let me start with the aspects of the film I like. Hanks' performance is utterly believable and touching. He makes Forrest seem utterly believable and sympathetic in spite of the cognitive challenges the man faces. The emotional climax of the story-Forrest visiting a person's grave-is very moving and it gives the appearance of grace to the entire film. Likewise, Forrest the character is a unique take on an American life and at least on the basic level of nostalgia I can get beyond his story. Lt. Dan and Jenny, to a far lesser degree, are also good characters. Apart from that there isn't much to like about this film. The main problem is the film has a cheap homespun conservatism to it that feels utterly banal and hateful to the social upheavals and yes progress of the 60's-70's. The film goes out of its way-literally at times-to mute liberal messages and its treatment of leftists (dysfunctional all according to the film) is off putting. It is not so much wrong as unbelievably disconnected to the history. Jenny's fate is especially cringe inducing in light of this aspect. Technically the film hasn't aged well. The special effects to insert Forrest into archival footage doesn't really work anymore. The feather looks really fake at the beginning of the film as well. It is a little baffling that this beat out 4 great films at the Oscars.\"\n",

        "review = \"Just came across your words, and I couldn't have said it better myself. What's really insulting to me is the film's Republican wet dream worldview. Basically the message here is that if you keep your mouth shut and don't question authority, you will become a great man (if you're a free-spirited hippie, you'll die an early death alone). Of course Gump is a 'simpleton'; any complex opinions might likewise bring out similar thoughts in the audience, and we can't have that is a big shiny Hollywood movie. (Yeah, Gump tried to speak out in DC, but the microphone went screwy...silenced by THE MAN! :) ) And what's with the ending? Let's see, AIDS, death, marriage, another death - all in twenty minutes. Jeez, it's shameless. NO WAY this is better than Shawshank! Morgan Freeman's performance both breaks my heart and fills me with hope (pretty much what Hanks tried and failed to do - and he won the friggin' Oscar). And Pulp Fiction changed audience's and Hollywood's perception of what a film can be, something that Gump didn't even attempt.\"\n",

        "review = \"Every once in a while, something comes along that hasn't been done before. This movie is one of those things. First of all, we have a principal character whose take on life is one where you don't judge it; you live it. I know he's a film character. It doesn't matter because we use images such as these to inspire us and to give us our own way of treating each day. Forrest lets no grass grow under his feet. He is the consummate optimist. He doesn't complain because he sees early on that it does you no good. His life is one adventure after another, in and out of the public eye, but his shyness and demeanor don't ever get to his head. He is the epitome of patience, something sadly lacking in the lives of most Americans. He is pushed around by the gusts of time and always lands on his feet. His relationship with a troubled girl is the one consistent thing in his life, and that is also shows his pugnaciousness. There are some commentators and reviewers who call this character stupid. He is a slow processor, but his stability lies in his morality and his consistency. His mother raised him well. Tom Hanks has become our new Jimmy Stewart. His roles are about human emotion and dedication. He is the everyman in many ways. Obviously, the subject matter has changed, but you can bank on his decision making when it comes to film. The other heroes are the special effects people. They are able to make this work; to create an incredible world for him to function within. The news clips are quite marvelous. I usually put this film in my top ten.\"\n",
